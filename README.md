# Smart Switch Box 
## 1. Introduction

Smart Switches are basically upgraded Electronic switches which has type and power status functions to control the switch states and power status. These connected devices and appliances perform tasks or automated routines to save energy,money or time or improve security.A smart switch is different from a traditional switch in that it can control just about anything it is connected with wired appliances fans and lights. Also unlike a traditional light switch, smart switches can be controlled by remotely through a smartphone app or via a remote control by connecting to home's wifi network.Some smart switches also function as a traditional light switch ,while others can be controlled by a smart app or device.Personal preferences of how to utilize smart switches . These switches help to reduce manpower, these smart switches provide more control over our home lights, fans,refrigerator ans as well as hard wired appliances

In this project a smart switch box is created which is a combination of smart switches. Through this box we can controll appliances like fan , bulb,fridge 
below is an image to illustrate the smart switch functionality.
